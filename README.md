###Optimizations Made to index.html
1. Used a web font loader to defer the loading of google fonts until AFTER other parts of the page have started to load. I also made it an asynchronous script.
2. Used a media query to prevent the print.css from render blocking
3. Changed script.css from an external file to internal css style sheet using a script tag and moving it over to the HTML
4. Compressed all images and reduced sizes where approprtiate.
5. Made a separate pizzaria image with a reduced size so that the index.html didn't need to reference the image in the views/images folder which was bigger than needed for the front page
6. Overall, improved the page speed insight score from around a 30/100 for mobile and desktop to a 98/100 for mobile and desktop!

###Optimizations made to views/js/main.js
1. Optimized the pizza resizing script 
  a. I separated the changePizzaSizes function into two separate functions to prevent recalculating layout and then style. To do this I made a separate function called layout that calculates the layout and then returns the results to be used later by the changePizzaSizes function. 
  b. I avoided accessing the DOM to get the randomPizzaContainer class  multiple times by accessing it outside of both functions and holding it variables.


## Website Performance Optimization portfolio project

Your challenge, if you wish to accept it (and we sure hope you will), is to optimize this online portfolio for speed! In particular, optimize the critical rendering path and make this page render as quickly as possible by applying the techniques you've picked up in the [Critical Rendering Path course](https://www.udacity.com/course/ud884).

To get started, check out the repository and inspect the code.

### Getting started

####Part 1: Optimize PageSpeed Insights score for index.html

Some useful tips to help you get started:

1. Check out the repository
1. To inspect the site on your phone, you can run a local server

  ```bash
  $> cd /path/to/your-project-folder
  $> python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8080
  ```

1. Open a browser and visit localhost:8080
1. Download and install [ngrok](https://ngrok.com/) to the top-level of your project directory to make your local server accessible remotely.

  ``` bash
  $> cd /path/to/your-project-folder
  $> ./ngrok http 8080
  ```

1. Copy the public URL ngrok gives you and try running it through PageSpeed Insights! Optional: [More on integrating ngrok, Grunt and PageSpeed.](http://www.jamescryer.com/2014/06/12/grunt-pagespeed-and-ngrok-locally-testing/)

Profile, optimize, measure... and then lather, rinse, and repeat. Good luck!

####Part 2: Optimize Frames per Second in pizza.html

To optimize views/pizza.html, you will need to modify views/js/main.js until your frames per second rate is 60 fps or higher. You will find instructive comments in main.js.

You might find the FPS Counter/HUD Display useful in Chrome developer tools described here: [Chrome Dev Tools tips-and-tricks](https://developer.chrome.com/devtools/docs/tips-and-tricks).

### Customization with Bootstrap
The portfolio was built on Twitter's <a href="http://getbootstrap.com/">Bootstrap</a> framework. All custom styles are in `dist/css/portfolio.css` in the portfolio repo.
